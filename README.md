# dynamicslicing

## Installation

```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

## Project Goals

The project aims to extract a subset of code from a given Python program that is relevant to specific
slicing criteria through dynamic analysis techniques. The scope of the analysis is within the execution
of a Python function.

The analysis of this project is mainly divided into two milestones, data flow slicing and data flow plus
control flow slicing. Generally speaking, data flow is statements with a sequential structure in Python,
and control flow is statements with a conditional or loop structure.

Please see "report_Application_of_dynamic_slicing_analysis_in_Python.pdf" for a more detailed project description.
